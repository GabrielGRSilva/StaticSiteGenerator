</div>

## ðŸ’¡ From the official course description:

This is a Static Site Generator built in Python, using concepts both from Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming, during Boot.Dev's SSG course. It is a fast way to convert markdown files into a fully functioning website, which you can then improve focusing on what really matters, as the basics will already be done!

## Usage:

Insert the relevant files (.md) in the content folder, in the page structure you desire. See the example files included.
